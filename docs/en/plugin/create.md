# Create an Application  

Create a MineAdmin Application  

## [Command Creation](./command.md#create-a-plugin)  

MineAdmin allows you to create an application via the command line. First, navigate your command line to the project's root directory, then enter the following command:  

```shell  
php bin/hyperf.php mine-extension:create test/demo --name test --type mix --author zds --description This is a mixed plugin  
```  

After executing this command, a plugin directory `plugin/test/demo` will be created. [Directory Structure](./structure.md)  

## Upload an Application  

Go to the [Application Submission Page](https://www.mineadmin.com/member/createApp), upload the application in a compressed (.zip) format, fill in the relevant information, and wait for administrator approval.
