# MineAdmin Plugin System

The MineAdmin plugin system provides powerful extensibility, allowing developers to create reusable functional modules to achieve system modularity and scalability.

## Plugin System Architecture

MineAdmin's plugin system is based on the Hyperf framework's ConfigProvider mechanism, offering complete plugin lifecycle management and automated deployment capabilities.

```plantuml
@startuml
!define RECTANGLE class

RECTANGLE "MineAdmin Core" as core {
  + bin/hyperf.php
  + Plugin::init()
}

RECTANGLE "Plugin Management" as mgmt {
  + App-Store Component
  + Extension Commands
  + Plugin Loader
}

RECTANGLE "Plugin Structure" as structure {
  + mine.json (Configuration file)
  + src/ (Backend code)
  + web/ (Frontend code)
  + Database/ (Database)
}

RECTANGLE "Official Plugins" as official {
  + app-store
}

core --> mgmt : Plugin initialization
mgmt --> structure : Load plugins
mgmt --> official : Manage official plugins
structure --> core : Register services

## Core Components

### 1. Plugin Loader
- **File**: `bin/hyperf.php` ([GitHub](https://github.com/mineadmin/mineadmin/blob/master/bin/hyperf.php))
- **Principle**: Automatically loads all installed plugins during application startup via `Plugin::init()`
- **Implementation**: Scans all plugins in the `plugin/` directory and registers their ConfigProvider

### 2. App-Store Component
- **Repository**: [mineadmin/appstore](https://github.com/mineadmin/appstore)
- **Functionality**: Provides plugin download, installation, uninstallation, update, and other management features
- **Configuration**: Registers services and configurations via `ConfigProvider`

### 3. Plugin Configuration System
- **Core File**: `mine.json`
- **Principle**: Defines plugin metadata, dependencies, installation scripts, and other information
- **Loading**: Parses and registers into the system during plugin installation

## Official Plugins

MineAdmin provides the following official plugins by default:

| Plugin Name | Description | Repository |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| app-store | Application marketplace management plugin, providing plugin download, installation, uninstallation, update, and other management features | [GitHub](https://github.com/mineadmin/appstore) |

> Note: Other plugins such as code generators, scheduled task managers, etc., can be obtained from the application marketplace or developed independently.

## Plugin Types

MineAdmin supports three types of plugins:

### Mixed (Hybrid Plugins)
Plugins containing both frontend and backend complete functionalities, providing full business modules.

### Backend (Backend Plugins)
Plugins containing only backend logic, primarily providing API services and business logic.

### Frontend (Frontend Plugins)
Plugins containing only frontend interfaces, primarily providing user interface components.

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

Developing MineAdmin plugins requires:

1. **Familiarity with the tech stack**: MineAdmin and Hyperf framework
2. **Obtaining AccessToken**:
   - Log in to [MineAdmin Official Website](https://www.mineadmin.com/login)
   - Go to Personal Center â†’ [Settings Page](https://www.mineadmin.com/member/setting)
   - Obtain AccessToken

3. **Configuring Environment Variables**:
```ini
# .env file
MINE_ACCESS_TOKEN=YourAccessToken
```

::: Warning
Please keep your AccessToken secure to avoid leakage!
