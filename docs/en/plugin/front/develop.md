Taking the [Create Plugin chapter](../create.md){style="color: green;" .custom-class #custom-id} as an example, the frontend directory should adhere to the following specifications:

1. The `plugin/test/demo/web` directory serves as the frontend directory
2. All files within this directory will be copied (existing files will be overwritten) to the specified frontend directory during plugin installation
