# Front-end Development Standards

---

Taking the [Create Plugin Chapter](../create.md){style="color: green;" .custom-class #custom-id} as an example, the front-end directory should adhere to the following standards:

1. The `plugin/test/demo/web` directory is the front-end directory.
2. All files in this directory will be copied (and overwritten if they already exist) to the specified front-end directory during plugin installation.
