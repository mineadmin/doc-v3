## "Not Found" error when accessing uploaded images or files

1. In a production environment, it is recommended to use Nginx as a proxy.

   The following Nginx configuration can be used as a reference (note the `.env` configuration and upload directory permissions). Please adjust the paths according to your actual deployment environment.
   Assuming the resource URL is `https://example.com/uploads/**/****.png`:
```nginx
# Proxy for image resources in the uploads directory
location /uploads/ {
    alias /mineadmin/storage/uploads/; # Example path, adjust according to your deployment environment
    expires 7d;
    add_header Cache-Control "public";  # Allow all users and intermediate caching servers (e.g., CDNs) to cache this resource for improved efficiency
    add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin https://example.com;  # Only allow cross-origin requests from https://example.com for enhanced security
}
```
2. In a development environment, configure the following in `/config/autoload/server.php`:
```php
'settings' => [
  // Enable external access
  Constant::OPTION_ENABLE_STATIC_HANDLER => env('APP_DEBUG', false),
  Constant::OPTION_DOCUMENT_ROOT => BASE_PATH . '/storage',
  //...
],
```
In the `.env` file, set `APP_DEBUG` to `true`. After configuration, restart the service.
