## Development Journey

Since MineAdmin 0.x, the backend system has undergone numerous iterations and optimizations.  

The backend Hyperf framework has evolved from version 2.0 to 3.0. The frontend initially used the SCUI open-source project, later transitioning to a self-developed framework based on Arco, and now adopting a brand-new architecture with a complete rewrite of both frontend and backend code, streamlining functionalities.  

In the new version, we started fresh, continuously optimizing the framework to deliver a better user experience. Our goal is to help developers get started quickly, focus on business logic, and create value for enterprises and brands.
