## Development History

Since the MineAdmin 0.x version, the backend system has undergone many iterations and optimizations.

The backend uses the Hyperf framework, which has been upgraded from 2.0 to 3.0. The front-end initially used the SCUI open-source front-end project, then developed a front-end framework based on Arco, and now adopts a completely new architecture, refactoring both front-end and back-end code, and streamlining features. In the new version, we started fresh, continuously optimizing the framework to provide a better user experience.
Our goal is to enable developers to quickly get started, focus on business logic development, and create value for enterprises and brands.
