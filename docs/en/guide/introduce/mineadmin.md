## Development Journey  

Since the MineAdmin 0.x version, the backend system has undergone numerous iterations and optimizations.  

The backend Hyperf framework has evolved from version 2.0 to 3.0. The frontend started with the SCUI open-source project, later transitioned to a self-developed framework based on Arco, and now adopts a brand-new architecture with refactored frontend and backend code, streamlining functionalities. In the new version, we started fresh, continuously optimizing the framework to deliver a better user experience.  

Our goal is to enable developers to get started quickly, focus on business logic development, and create value for enterprises and brands.
