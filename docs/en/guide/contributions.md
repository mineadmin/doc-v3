* Help users by answering their questions in the comments.  
* Propose reasonable solutions based on the [Issues](https://github.com/mineadmin/mineadmin/issues) content, fix bugs, or implement features, then submit them as a [Pull Request](https://github.com/mineadmin/mineadmin/pulls) to the MineAdmin repository.

* Develop independent functional components based on your own or others' needs.  
* Improve the [documentation](https://gitee.com/mineadmin/doc-v3) to provide better usage instructions.  

### Pull Request Guidelines  

While we periodically post features awaiting development, we highly encourage you to propose ideas you'd like to implement. You can share your thoughts in [Issues](https://github.com/mineadmin/mineadmin/issues), and we'll respond promptly on whether they'll be accepted.  
Before submitting an issue, check if a similar one already exists.  

* Fork this repository to your GitHub account.  
* Commit messages should follow the format: **[File Name]: Info about commit.** (Example) `README.md: Fix xxx bug`  
* Before submitting code, run `composer cs-fix` to format your code.  
* Before submitting code, run `composer an` for static code analysis.  
* Before submitting code, run `composer test` for unit testing. **Do not run unit tests in any production environment**, as it will delete added data.  
* Ensure your PR is created from a feature branch, not directly from the `master` branch.  
* If your PR fixes a bug, include a description of the related bug.
