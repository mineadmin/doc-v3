# Icons

## Solution
The system does not actually integrate the `Element Plus` icon library because `Iconify` is already included.

- Iconify Icons (Recommended)
- Using Alibaba Icon Library

## Using Iconify Icons
::: tip Note
`Iconify` is a universal icon framework that includes icon sets such as FontAwesome, Material Design Icons, DashIcons, Feather Icons, EmojiOne, Noto Emoji, and more.
It contains over 150 icon sets and 200k icons, supporting many front-end frameworks.
:::

It is generally recommended to search for icons on [Ic√¥nes](https://icones.js.org/), an online icon search website based on `Iconify`, which offers a better user experience.

::: info Attention
The copied icon format is: `i-{collection name}:{icon name}`

### Using the MaSvgIcon Component

After finding the icon, copy the icon name and use the `MaSvgIcon` component to display the icon:

```vue
<!-- Paste the copied icon name into the name attribute -->
<ma-svg-icon name="i-vscode-icons:file-type-php" />
```

### Using Class
You can use it directly via `html` tags, but note that **asynchronous** and **concatenated** string usage is not supported.

```html
<span class="i-vscode-icons:file-type-php" />
<i class="i-vscode-icons:file-type-php" />
```

### Offline Mode
Since `Iconify` icons are provided as an online service by default, the first call triggers an external network request to fetch the SVG raw data,
which is then cached in `localStorage`. Subsequent calls will retrieve and display the icon directly from the cache. However, if there is no network, the icons may not display correctly.

To address this, the system provides a command: `pnpm run gen:icons`. Follow the command prompts to select the icon sets you need and choose the offline mode to generate an offline icon library.

::: warning Attention
The offline icon library generated by the command is also the icon collection displayed in the `icon picker`.

## Using Alibaba Icon Library

Place the SVG icon files downloaded from the [Alibaba Icon Library](https://www.iconfont.cn/) or other sources into the `./src/assets/icons/` directory,
and use them via the `MaSvgIcon` component:

```vue
<!-- SVG icon file path ./src/assets/icons/newIcon.svg -->

<ma-svg-icon name="newIcon" />
```
