# Icons

## Solutions
The system does not actually integrate the `Element plus` icon library since `Iconify` is already included.

- Iconify Icons (Recommended)
- Using Alibaba Icon Library


## Using Iconify Icons
::: tip Note
`Iconify` is a universal icon framework that includes icon collections such as FontAwesome, Material Design Icons, DashIcons, Feather Icons, EmojiOne, Noto Emoji, and more.  
It contains over 150 icon sets and 200k icons, supporting many frontend frameworks.
:::

For searching icons, it is generally recommended to visit [Ic√¥nes](https://icones.js.org/), an online icon search website based on `Iconify`, which offers a better user experience.

::: info Note
The copied icon format is: `i-{collection-name}:{icon-name}`

### Using the MaSvgIcon Component

After finding an icon, copy its name and display it using the `MaSvgIcon` component:

```vue
<!-- Paste the copied icon name into the name attribute -->
<ma-svg-icon name="i-vscode-icons:file-type-php" />
```

### Using in Class
You can use it directly in HTML tags, but note that **asynchronous** and **concatenated string** usage is not supported.

```html
<span class="i-vscode-icons:file-type-php" />
<i class="i-vscode-icons:file-type-php" />
```

### Offline Mode
By default, `Iconify` icons are provided via an online service. The first call triggers an external network request to fetch the SVG raw data, which is then cached in `localStorage`. Subsequent calls retrieve and display the icon directly from the cache. However, without an internet connection, the icons may not display properly.

To address this, the system provides a command: `pnpm run gen:icons`. Follow the command prompts to select the icon sets you need and choose offline mode to generate an offline icon library.

::: warning Note
The offline icon library generated by the command is also the collection displayed in the **icon picker**.

## Using Alibaba Icon Library

Download SVG icon files from the [Alibaba Icon Library](https://www.iconfont.cn/) or other sources and place them in the `./src/assets/icons/` directory.  
Use them via the `MaSvgIcon` component:
```vue
<!-- SVG icon file path: ./src/assets/icons/newIcon.svg -->

<ma-svg-icon name="newIcon" />
```
