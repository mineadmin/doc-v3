# Internationalization Configuration

The frontend project has integrated `Vue i18n`. When making requests, it will automatically fetch the corresponding language text from the backend based on the current language. The backend implementation is not covered here; interested parties can refer to the source code.

The frontend currently supports three language packs: `Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), and English`.

## Recommended Plugins

- If you use `VSCode`, it is recommended to install [i18n Ally](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Lokalise.i18n-ally).
- If you use `WebStorm`, it is recommended to install [Easy i18n](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16316-easy-i18n).

These plugins will greatly assist you in maintaining language packs.

## Language Pack Definitions

::: tip Must Read
`Vue i18n` supports two types of language packs: **global language packs** and **local language packs**. Local language packs, also known as in-file language packs, are only used within `.vue` files. Global language packs support `.vue`, `.tsx`, and `.jsx` files.

Language packs are defined using `YAML` format syntax, which is much more comfortable to write than `JSON`.

If you need to extend other languages, pay attention to the format; otherwise, the defined language packs may not be found. The format is: `Language Identifier[Language Name]`
- en[English].yaml
- zh_CN[简体中文].yaml
- zh_TW[繁體中文].yaml
:::

### Global Language Packs
Global language packs are stored in three forms, all of which are automatically scanned and imported by the system:
- Under the `src/locales` directory.
- Under the `src/modules/<module_name>/locales` directory.
- Under the `src/plugins/<plugin_name>/locales` directory.

::: danger Important Notes
The global language packs under **modules** and **plugins** must have the same filenames as those under `src/locales`. Otherwise, console warnings about missing `key` will appear (which can be quite annoying).
:::

### Local Language Packs
All `.vue` files in the project support local language packs. Simply define the `i18n` tag within the `.vue` file, as shown below:
```vue
<i18n lang="yaml">
zh_CN:
  hello: 你好
zh_TW:
  hello: 你好
en:
  hello: hello
</i18n>

<script setup lang="ts">
</script>

<template>
</template>

<style>
</style>
```

## Usage

First, you can manually import `Vue i18n`. Once you have the `i18n` object, you can use its `t` method to retrieve text, as shown below:
```ts
import { i18n } from 'vue-i18n'

// Global mode
const { t } = i18n()

// Local mode
const { t } = i18n({
  inheritLocale: true,
  useScope: 'local',
})
```

However, the frontend project has already encapsulated a method to obtain the `i18n` object. Simply use the `useTrans()` method within the `setup` function, as shown below:

```ts
// useTrans() is automatically imported
const trans = useTrans()

// useTrans() returns an object containing both global and local objects:
// trans.globalTrans and trans.localTrans

trans.globalTrans('global.title')
trans.localTrans('title')

// You can also use it directly. By default, it first looks for the global key; if not found, it searches for the local key.
useTrans('title')
```

In addition, there is a `useLocalTrans()` method, which only returns the local `i18n` object and requires manual import, as shown below:
```ts
import useLocalTrans from '@/hooks/useLocalTrans'

// Only searches for keys within the current file
const t = useLocalTrans()

// Two ways to use it
t('title')
useLocalTrans('title')
```
